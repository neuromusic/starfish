.. _ExpressionMatrixSpecification:

ExpressionMatrix
================
The :py:class:`ExpressionMatrix` is a 2-dimensional :code:`cells (x)` by :code:`genes (y)` array
whose values contain the expression of a gene in a particular cell. The :py:class:`ExpressionMatrix`
is additionally annotated with the :code:`x, y, z` coordinates of the centroid of the cell in
a pixel space, and :code:`xc, yc, zc` in global coordinate space. Additional metadata may be added
at the user's convenience to either the cells or genes.

Data
----
Gene expression are stored as numeric values, typically as integers in Image-based transcriptomics
experiments, since they represent counted fluorescent spots, each corresponding to a single detected
RNA molecule.

Metadata
--------

:code:`cells; cell_id (int):` cell identifier

:code:`cells; x, y, z (int):` coordinates of cell centroid in pixel space

:code:`cells; xc, yc, zc (int):` coordinates of cell centroid in global coordinate space (um)

:code:`genes; gene_id (int):` GENCODE gene ID

:code:`genes; gene_name (int):` Human-readable gene symbol (e.g. HGNC gene symbol for human data)

Implementation
--------------
Starfish Implements the :py:class:`ExpressionMatrix` as an :code:`xarray.DataArray` object to take
advantage of `xarray's`_ high performance, flexible metadata storage capabilities, and Serialization
options

Serialization
-------------
The :py:class:`ExpressionMatrix` can leverage any of the :code:`xarray` serialization features,
including csv, zarr, and netcdf. We choose netcdf as it currently has the strongest support and
interoperability between R and python. Users can load and manipulate :py:class:`ExpressionMatrix`
using R by loading them with the `ncdf4`_ package. In the future, NetCDF serialization may be
deprecated if R gains Zarr support.
